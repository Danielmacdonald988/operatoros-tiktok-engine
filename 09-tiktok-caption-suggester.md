# Prompt: TikTok Caption Suggester

## Purpose:
Generate a short, emotionally resonant caption based on a structured session, tone classification, or summary. These captions are used as text overlays in TikTok videos to capture attention and frame the story.

## Input:
One of the following:
- Structured session summary
- Session reflection summary
- Tone + topic description

Example:
> The user is experiencing emotional burnout but expresses a desire for direct clarity instead of comfort. The tone is honest and tired, but willing.

## Output:
A single caption line under 90 characters.

## Requirements:
- Emotionally sharp — should feel like the **emotional subtitle** of the video
- Must reflect the original tone (supportive, direct, humorous, etc.)
- No hashtags or emojis
- No quotes around the line
- Not clinical — poetic, sharp, or raw is best

## Format:
Plain text caption only. No formatting or metadata.

## Examples:
- Trying to stay strong is what’s breaking you  
- Numb isn’t nothing. It’s what you feel when nothing feels safe  
- Clarity costs something too  
- You’re not lazy. You’re just out of places to hold it
