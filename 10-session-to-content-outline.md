# Prompt: Session to Content Outline

## Purpose:
Transform a completed coaching session log into a short-form video outline designed for platforms like TikTok or Reels. The output should blend emotional storytelling with insight, structured in discrete, compelling scenes.

## Input:
A full markdown-formatted session log that includes:
- User input and summary
- Structured session/tone classification
- Coach reply
- Feedback (if present)
- Suggested next session

## Output:
A structured markdown outline for a TikTok video with 5–7 brief scenes.

Each scene = 1–2 emotionally resonant lines that can be recorded or captioned visually.

## Sections:

### Hook (1–2 lines)
- Open with a question, contradiction, or pain point
- Hint at the emotional loop (without resolving it)
- Must stop the scroll

### Scene 1: The Struggle
- User's inner state or surface problem
- Brief and relatable

### Scene 2: The Realization
- What was really going on?
- Emotional turning point, tone match emphasized

### Scene 3: The Shift
- Coach’s cue or reframing moment
- User perspective changes

### Scene 4: The Action
- Strategy, step, or commitment taken
- Must feel doable

### Scene 5: The Loop Closes
- Emotional resonance or clarity statement
- Optionally pull back to universality

### CTA (Call to Action)
- 1 sentence: challenge the viewer, ask a question, or prompt engagement

## Guidelines:
- Keep each scene 1–2 short lines (max 20 words)
- Maintain the tone of the session (direct, gentle, reflective, humorous)
- Use real language — no jargon, no overly clinical phrasing
- Never quote directly — paraphrase the emotional arc
- Focus on truth, not polish

## Example:

**Input:**
A session about feeling invisible at work, discovering suppressed confidence, and choosing to speak up in a team meeting.

**Output:**

### Hook:
What if staying quiet is what’s been keeping you stuck?

### Scene 1:
I told her I felt invisible — like no one saw what I was trying to do.

### Scene 2:
She asked me, “Who taught you not to take up space?”

### Scene 3:
That hit. I realized I was trained to shrink.

### Scene 4:
We made a plan to speak up in tomorrow’s meeting — even just once.

### Scene 5:
I don’t need to be loud. I just need to be real.

### CTA:
What’s one place you’re tired of staying silent?
